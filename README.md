<h1 align="center">Blogosphere Personal Blogging Platform</h1>

<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

<h3 align="left">Blogosphere is a blogging platform that I developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, MySQL and Maven. Itâ€™s a site that facilitates CRUD operations, allowing users to create their own accounts and manage their posts. I integrated user authentication and authorization, enabling the creation of personal accounts and post management. I added privacy settings that allow users to control the visibility of their posts. I also incorporated an admin panel for administrative control over the platform. Additionally, the platform allows users to rate and comment on posts, fostering an interactive community</h3>
